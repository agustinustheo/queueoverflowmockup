Our platform uses machine intelligence to understand human communication at scale, allowing us to protect some of the world’s largest organisations from threats executable by humans. We believe that our product, whilst highly technical, should deliver a best-in-class user experience where complexity is hidden.

If you're also able to use a little Python to plug our frontend into our backend that's a plus! Dealing with massive datasets at scale requires ingenuity and strong analytical skills. Our approach to problem solving means we favour hiring engineers who pride themselves on the ability to learn new skills, their comfort with the unknown and their willingness to experiment.
